Creating a blog using Zend Framework . I am learning zend framework and also learning git .

I have not added any authentication at present . 

Added authentication and authorization . Its not implemented in a proper way now . I want to change many things .

As I am new to Zend_ACL and Zend_Auth I have made this for my convinience :)

There may be errors from my part as I am learning . You can download and use at your own risk .
